# Cunitas-Project
Our project for Cunitas, a store dedicated to baby products, aims to develop a custom Content Management System (CMS) and Document Management System (DMS) to allow Cunitas to more easily manage its product catalog and better organize internal information. Additionally, it includes the creation of internal and external corporate social networks, in order to improve team communication and customer interaction.

The ultimate goal is to create a tool that Cunitas can use in its daily operations, enhance the team's workflow, and help the store grow in a more organized and efficient way.
