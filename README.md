# Project Topic
Our project for Cunitas, a store specializing in baby products, aims to develop a custom Content Management System (CMS) and Document Management System (DMS) to enable Cunitas to more easily manage its product catalog and better organize internal information. Additionally, the project includes the creation of internal and external corporate social networks to enhance team communication and customer interaction.

The ultimate goal is to provide Cunitas with a tool that can be used in its day-to-day operations, improving the team's workflow and helping the store grow in a more organized and efficient manner.
